# Next Tech Task: Arduino Robot
This is my submission for Next Tech's Tesla Lab recruitment task. This project is a simple robot that uses IR sensors to follow a line or take in user input using an IR remote to move around. The circuit was put together on TinkerCAD and can be viewed here: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/3Zjc1u93jdv
